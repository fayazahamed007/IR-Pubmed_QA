['In Queensland, Australia, the incidence of cancer (all cancers combined) is 21% lower for Indigenous people compared with non-Indigenous people but mortality is 36% higher. Support services play an important role in helping cancer patients through their cancer journey. Indigenous cancer patients are likely to face greater unmet supportive care needs and more barriers to accessing cancer care and support. Other barriers include the higher proportion of Indigenous people who live remotely and in regional areas, a known difficulty for access to health services. This study describes the availability of cancer support services in Queensland for Indigenous patients and relevant location.', \"Using a set criteria 121 services were selected from a pre-existing database (n = 344) of cancer services. These services were invited to complete an online questionnaire. ArcGIS (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/index.html) was used to map the services' location (using postcode) against Indigenous population by local government area. Services were classified as an 'Indigenous' or 'Indigenous friendly' service using set criteria.\", \"Eighty-three services (73.6%) completed the questionnaire. Mapping revealed services are located where there are relatively low percentages of Indigenous people compared with the whole population. No 'Indigenous-specific' services were identified; however, 11 services (13%) were classed 'Indigenous-friendly'. The primary support offered by these services was 'information'. Fewer referrals were received from Indigenous liaison officers compared with other health professionals. Only 8.6% of services reported frequently having contact with an Indigenous organisation; however, 44.6% of services reported that their staff participated in cultural training. Services also identified barriers to access which may exist for Indigenous clientele, including no Indigenous staff and the costs involved in accessing the service, but were unable to address these issues due to restricted staff and funding capacity.\"]  ['INTRODUCTION', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']                                                    ['Administrative Personnel', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Catchment Area (Health)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Financing, Government', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services, Indigenous', 'Humans', 'Information Services', 'Neoplasms', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Population Groups', 'Queensland', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']                2012.0  Further research into the best models for providing culturally appropriate cancer support services to Indigenous people is essential to ensure Indigenous patients are well supported throughout their cancer journey. Emphasis should be placed on providing support services where a high Indigenous population percentage resides to ensure support is maintained in rural and remote settings. Further efforts should be placed on relationships with Indigenous organisations and mainstream support services and encouraging referral from Indigenous liaison officers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

Both cases were successfully treated in a process that involved topical application of sulfuric ether, mechanical removal of larvae, and surgical debridement.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ['OBJECTIVE', 'CASE REPORT']                                                              ['Administration, Topical', 'Alcoholism', 'Animals', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Debridement', 'Gingival Diseases', 'Humans', 'Larva', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myiasis', 'Sulfides']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2012.0  Oral myiasis can be treated effectively with surgery after topical application of sulfuric ether.

['Elevated serum phosphorus (P) levels have been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) but may be difficult to control if parathyroid hormone (PTH) is persistently elevated. We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from an earlier interventional study (OPTIMA) to explore the relationship between PTH control and serum P.', 'The OPTIMA study randomized dialysis patients with intact PTH (iPTH) 300-799 pg/mL to receive conventional care alone (vitamin D and/or phosphate binders [PB]; n=184) or a cinacalcet-based regimen (n=368). For patients randomized to conventional care, investigators were allowed flexibility in using a non-cinacalcet regimen (with no specific criteria for vitamin D analogue dosage) to attain KDOQIâ„¢ targets for iPTH, P, Ca and Ca x P. For those assigned to the cinacalcet-based regimen, dosages of cinacalcet, vitamin D sterols, and PB were optimized over the first 16 weeks of the study, using a predefined treatment algorithm. The present analysis examined achievement of serum P targets (â‰¤ 4.5 and â‰¤ 5.5 mg/dL) in relation to achievement of iPTH â‰¤ 300 pg/mL during the efficacy assessment phase (EAP; weeks 17-23).', 'Patients who achieved iPTH â‰¤ 300 pg/mL (or a reduction of â‰¥ 30% from baseline) were more likely to achieve serum P targets than those who did not, regardless of treatment group. Of those who did achieve iPTH â‰¤ 300 pg/mL, 43% achieved P â‰¤ 4.5 mg/dL and 70% achieved P â‰¤ 5.5 mg/dL, versus 21% and 46% of those who did not achieve iPTH â‰¤ 300 pg/mL. Doses of PB tended to be higher in patients not achieving serum P targets. Patients receiving cinacalcet were more likely to achieve iPTH â‰¤ 300 pg/mL than those receiving conventional care (73% vs 23% of patients). Logistic regression analysis identified lower baseline P, no PB use at baseline and cinacalcet treatment to be predictors of achieving P â‰¤ 4.5 mg/dL during EAP in patients above this threshold at baseline.']                                                                 ['BACKGROUND', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']                                                      ['Adult', 'Aged', 'Causality', 'Comorbidity', 'Dialysis', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Phosphorus', 'Prevalence', 'Renal Insufficiency', 'Risk Factors']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2012.0  This post hoc analysis found that control of serum P in dialysis patients was better when serum PTH levels were lowered effectively, regardless of treatment received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

['Inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between alcohol consumption and depression, including whether the relationship is J-shaped or U-shaped, may be at least partly due to the types of measures used for both alcohol consumption and depression.', 'We conducted a general population survey using random digit dialing (RDD) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) with 6,009 males and 8,054 females aged 18 to 76 years. The survey included 4 types of alcohol measures (frequency, usual and maximum quantity per occasion, volume, and heavy episodic drinking) covering both the past week and the past year, and 2 types of depression measures (meeting DSM criteria for a clinical diagnosis of major depression, recent depressed affect).', 'The overall relationship between depression and alcohol consumption did not vary by gender or type of depression measure but did vary significantly by type of alcohol measure, with the strongest relationship found for heavy episodic drinking and high quantity per occasion. There were also significant gender interactions with both depression and alcohol measures, with females showing a stronger relationship than males when depression was measured as meeting the criteria for major depression and when alcohol consumption was measured as quantity per occasion or heavy episodic drinking. There was some evidence of a J-shaped relationship, that is, greater depression among abstainers compared with those who usually drank 1 drink and never drank as much as 5 drinks for both former drinkers and lifetime abstainers when depression was measured as recent symptoms of depression but the J shape was found only for former drinkers when depression was measured as meeting the criteria for major depression and did not reach statistical significance in some analyses.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ['BACKGROUND', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS']                                                      ['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Canada', 'Data Collection', 'Depression', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Sex Factors', 'Telephone', 'Temperance']                                                                                                                                                                                                           2007.0  The results of the present study suggest that measurement and gender are key issues in interpreting findings on the relationship between alcohol and depression. First, depression is primarily related to drinking larger quantities per occasion, less related to volume, and unrelated to drinking frequency, and this effect is stronger for women than for men. Second, the overall relationship between depression and alcohol consumption is stronger for women than for men only when depression is measured as meeting a clinical diagnosis of major depression and not when measured as recent depressed affect. Finally, while there was some evidence that former drinkers had slightly higher rates of major depression and higher scores on recent depressed affect compared with light drinkers, there was no evidence that light drinking was protective for major depression when compared with lifetime abstainers, although light drinkers did report fewer recent symptoms of depressed affect.    1\n",
